### Task 
- Implement the __Quicksort__ algorithm. (45%)
- Implement the __Counting Sort__ algorithm. (45%)
- Write readable and well-commented code. (10%)

### Tips & Suggestions
- __Register__ yourself by putting your names and matriculation numbers in the header fields!
- Test your algorithm with edge case inputs and the provided unit tests!
- Your solutions will be run against these unit tests once pushed!
- Write elegant code! :dancer:
- Use a text editor + command line (Visual Studio Code would be my suggestion) for programming!
- Please, keep the submission folder as “clean” as you can! It’s fine if you have all the files in the root directory; it will make the evaluation process faster and easier :neutral_face:
